# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning

This project recommends the best crop to grow based on soil and weather conditions.

## ✅ Features

- Suggests suitable crops using machine learning
- Based on input parameters:
  - Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium
  - Temperature, Humidity
  - pH level
  - Rainfall

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib (for graphs)

## 📁 Files

- `Crop_recommendation.csv`: Dataset used
- `model.py`: ML model training and prediction
- `README.md`: Project info (this file)

## 📊 Output

The model predicts crops like rice, maize, cotton, etc., with high accuracy.
